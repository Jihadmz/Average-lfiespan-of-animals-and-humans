# expected-age-of-animals
This project is about describing the average lifespan of some animals and humans, as well as comparing both species.

This dataset is obtained through web scraping technology on this [site](https://www.futurelearn.com/info/courses/maths-linear-quadratic/0/steps/12167).

Then, to better understand the result, I have made some visualizations:
